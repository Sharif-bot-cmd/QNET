# üåê QNET: Hybrid Decentralized Web Node

## What‚Äôs New in QNET 1.4

- Cached `state.json` allows instant boot using last known mode.
- Background network probing (IPFS, I2P, TOR) runs asynchronously.
- Full offline support with cached state and deferred sync.
- Parallel detection for IPFS / I2P / TOR (`detect_mode()` upgraded).
- Auto-starts local daemons if not running.
- Multi-mode support (`MULTI`) for hybrid networks.
- Each QNET node now generates its own cryptographic identity.
- Based on [NaCl (libsodium)](https://pynacl.readthedocs.io/) signing keys.
- Stored locally in `did.json`.
- Used to verify authenticity of posts, uploads, and peer syncs.
- New **LAN broadcast discovery** (`announce_peer()` + `listen_for_peers()`).
- Automatic peer merging ‚Äî no manual editing of `peers.json`.
- `/api/sync` endpoint allows nodes to exchange databases directly.
- Background sync thread runs continuously without blocking UI.
- Automatic JSON database backup every 6 hours (`/backups/`).
- Integrity check & recovery if corruption is detected.
- Fully offline repair cycle with no external dependencies.
- Filename sanitization on uploads (no traversal or injection).
- Simple IP-based rate limiter (30 requests/minute per client).
- Thread-safe state saving with atomic `.tmp` write replacement.
- Live decentralized status badge at bottom-left of every page.

## ‚ú® Why QNET Stands Out

Modern web platforms rely on centralized data centers and third-party APIs.  
QNET removes that dependency, letting anyone host their own mini web node, private when desired, global when chosen.

It combines edge computing, local-first design, and network autonomy in a single package.

## üöÄ Key Features

- **Hybrid Network Modes**
  - Offline, I2P, TOR, or IPFS auto-detection.
  - Global access via Cloudflare or Ngrok tunnels.

- **Secure File System**
  - Upload, share, and stream files (videos, posts, leaks).
  - Each item is hashed and optionally mirrored to IPFS.

- **Built-in Security Levels**
  - üü¢ **Standard**: Global tunnels active  
  - üü° **Safer**: Encrypted peers only  
  - üî¥ **Safest**: Fully offline, no external tunnels

- **Web Dashboard**
  - Terminal-inspired green-on-black interface.
  - Fully responsive and local-first.

- **Cross-Platform Support**
  - Runs seamlessly on Android (Termux), Linux, macOS, Windows, etc.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Note:** IPFS mirror requires a running IPFS daemon (`ipfs daemon`) to access content locally.

## üîí Privacy & Security

- No external tracking or analytics.  
- Optional offline mode ensures complete privacy.  
- Security levels let you choose between fully offline or global accessibility.  
- Data files are hashed and stored locally; optional mirroring to IPFS does not expose your identity.  

---

## üß∞ Installation & Setup

QNET 1.0 is cross-platform and runs on **Linux**, **Android (Termux)**, **macOS**, and **Windows (via WSL or Git Bash)**.

Before running QNET, make sure you have:
- Python 3.10+  
- pip (Python package manager)  
- IPFS  
- curl  
- wget  

---

### üîß Quick Setup (Recommended)

QNET includes an automatic environment setup script that installs all dependencies for you.

Run this command from the project folder:
---
bash setup.sh

## üìö Usage

1. Run qnet.py (online/offline)
---
python qnet.py

3. Ensure your IPFS daemon is running for local content:  
---
ipfs daemon

4. Open your preferred mirror

Local: http://127.0.0.1:8080

IPFS: http://127.0.0.1:8081/ipfs/QmSk6tx2phgMny2guUoSgYdBXgMuWCPXT3ppJY8NYGqiLZ

Cloudflare/Ngrok tunnel (auto-generated)

5. Upload files (videos, posts, leaks) via the dashboard.

6. Upload & Manage Content

Upload files under Videos, Posts, or Leaks.

Share IPFS or Cloudflare links directly.

7. Adjust Security Level

Use Settings ‚Üí Security Level to switch between Standard, Safer, or Safest.
