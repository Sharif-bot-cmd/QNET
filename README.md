# üåê QNET: Hybrid Decentralized Web Node

## What‚Äôs New in QNET 1.2

> In-Node Web Preview System
QNET now includes a built-in /preview sandbox ‚Äî view external websites, IPFS pages, and links without ever leaving your node.
All requests are proxied, framed, and sanitized to keep you anonymous and tracking-free.

> Private Search 
The /search tab now performs hybrid local + DuckDuckGo lookups, but every external result opens through the new /preview layer ‚Äî meaning no redirection, no new tabs, no trackers.

> User Accounts (Sign Up / Login)
Local JSON-based registration added for self-hosted authentication.
Passwords are SHA-256 hashed and never transmitted externally.

> YouTube / Invidious Bridge
QNET auto-detects reachable Invidious instances and falls back to the YouTube Data API v3 for seamless video search and playback inside QNET.

QNET is a self-contained, privacy-first micro network that transforms your device into a decentralized web portal ‚Äî capable of operating **offline**, through **I2P/TOR/IPFS**, or globally via **Cloudflare Tunnel** or **Ngrok**.

It‚Äôs lightweight, fast, and designed to run anywhere ‚Äî from Linux and Android (Termux) to macOS or Windows.

## ‚ú® Why QNET Stands Out

Modern web platforms rely on centralized data centers and third-party APIs.  
QNET removes that dependency, letting anyone host their own mini web node, private when desired, global when chosen.

It combines edge computing, local-first design, and network autonomy in a single package.

## üöÄ Key Features

- **Hybrid Network Modes**
  - Offline, I2P, TOR, or IPFS auto-detection.
  - Global access via Cloudflare or Ngrok tunnels.

- **Secure File System**
  - Upload, share, and stream files (videos, posts, leaks).
  - Each item is hashed and optionally mirrored to IPFS.

- **Built-in Security Levels**
  - üü¢ **Standard**: Global tunnels active  
  - üü° **Safer**: Encrypted peers only  
  - üî¥ **Safest**: Fully offline, no external tunnels

- **Web Dashboard**
  - Terminal-inspired green-on-black interface.
  - Fully responsive and local-first.

- **Cross-Platform Support**
  - Runs seamlessly on Android (Termux), Linux, macOS, Windows, etc.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Note:** IPFS mirror requires a running IPFS daemon (`ipfs daemon`) to access content locally.

## üîí Privacy & Security

- No external tracking or analytics.  
- Optional offline mode ensures complete privacy.  
- Security levels let you choose between fully offline or global accessibility.  
- Data files are hashed and stored locally; optional mirroring to IPFS does not expose your identity.  

---

## üß∞ Installation & Setup

QNET 1.0 is cross-platform and runs on **Linux**, **Android (Termux)**, **macOS**, and **Windows (via WSL or Git Bash)**.

Before running QNET, make sure you have:
- Python 3.10+  
- pip (Python package manager)  
- IPFS  
- curl  
- wget  

---

### üîß Quick Setup (Recommended)

QNET includes an automatic environment setup script that installs all dependencies for you.

Run this command from the project folder:
---
bash setup.sh

## üìö Usage

1. Run qnet.py (online/offline)
---
python qnet.py

3. Ensure your IPFS daemon is running for local content:  
---
ipfs daemon

4. Open your preferred mirror

Local: http://127.0.0.1:8080

IPFS: http://127.0.0.1:8081/ipfs/QmSk6tx2phgMny2guUoSgYdBXgMuWCPXT3ppJY8NYGqiLZ

Cloudflare/Ngrok tunnel (auto-generated)

5. Upload files (videos, posts, leaks) via the dashboard.

6. Upload & Manage Content

Upload files under Videos, Posts, or Leaks.

Share IPFS or Cloudflare links directly.

7. Adjust Security Level

Use Settings ‚Üí Security Level to switch between Standard, Safer, or Safest.
