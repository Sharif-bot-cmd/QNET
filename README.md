# üåê QNET 1.0: Hybrid Decentralized Web Node

QNET is a self-contained, privacy-first micro network that transforms your device into a decentralized web portal ‚Äî capable of operating **offline**, through **I2P/TOR/IPFS**, or globally via **Cloudflare Tunnel** or **Ngrok**.

It‚Äôs lightweight, fast, and designed to run anywhere, from Linux and Android (Termux) to macOS or Windows.

## ‚ú® Why QNET Stands Out

Modern web platforms rely on centralized data centers and third-party APIs.  
QNET removes that dependency, letting anyone host their own mini web node, private when desired, global when chosen.

It combines edge computing, local-first design, and network autonomy in a single package.

## üöÄ Key Features

- Hybrid Network Modes
  - Offline, I2P, TOR, or IPFS auto-detection.
  - Global access via Cloudflare or Ngrok tunnels.

- Secure File System
  - Upload, share, and stream files (videos, posts, leaks).
  - Each item is hashed and optionally mirrored to IPFS.

- Built-in Security Levels
  - üü¢ Standard: Global tunnels active  
  - üü° Safer: Encrypted peers only  
  - üî¥ Safest: Fully offline, no external tunnels

- Web Dashboard
  - Terminal-inspired green-on-black interface.
  - Fully responsive and local-first.

- Cross-Platform Support
  - Runs seamlessly on Android (Termux), Linux, macOS, Windows, etc.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Note: IPFS mirror requires a running IPFS daemon (`ipfs daemon`) to access content locally.

## üîí Privacy & Security

- No external tracking or analytics.
- Optional offline mode ensures complete privacy.
- Security levels let you choose between fully offline or global accessibility.
- Data files are hashed and stored locally; optional mirroring to IPFS does not expose your identity.

## üìö Usage

1. Run qnet.py (online/offline)
---
python qnet.py

3. Ensure your IPFS daemon is running for local content:  
---
ipfs daemon

5. Open your preferred mirror in a browser (local, IPFS, or Cloudflare tunnel).

6. Upload files (videos, posts, leaks) via the dashboard.

7. Share links from IPFS or Cloudflare if desired.

8. Adjust security levels via the dashboard to control network exposure.
