# üåê QNET: Hybrid Decentralized Web Node

## What‚Äôs New in QNET 1.3

- Fixed critical login bug where valid accounts returned ‚ÄúInvalid username/password.‚Äù
- Unified `signup` and `login` to use the same `users.json` database.
- Implemented proper password verification with `verify_pw()` (supports salted hashes).
- Simplified session management using signed cookies (`sign()` / `verify_signed()`).
- Added runtime `SESSION_DATA` fallback to prevent session errors.
- Improved logout reliability (cookie cleanup and redirect flow).
- Cleaned `get_user()` logic ‚Äî now checks `users.json` instead of `accounts.json`.
- Strengthened file upload sanitization to prevent unsafe filenames.
- Enhanced database loader for safer JSON reads and writes.
- Added consistent cookie preservation across all pages.
- Improved stability for `detect_mode()` and global tunnel startup logs.
- Polished profile header: clear ‚ÄúLogged in as ‚Ä¶ | Logout‚Äù display.
- Fixed cookie persistence so login status remains visible across tabs.
- Added minor CSS refinements and code readability improvements.
- Hardened request handling with extra exception safety.
- Reduced blocking behavior in network detection and tunnel start.
- General refactoring for smoother offline-first behavior.

## ‚ú® Why QNET Stands Out

Modern web platforms rely on centralized data centers and third-party APIs.  
QNET removes that dependency, letting anyone host their own mini web node, private when desired, global when chosen.

It combines edge computing, local-first design, and network autonomy in a single package.

## üöÄ Key Features

- **Hybrid Network Modes**
  - Offline, I2P, TOR, or IPFS auto-detection.
  - Global access via Cloudflare or Ngrok tunnels.

- **Secure File System**
  - Upload, share, and stream files (videos, posts, leaks).
  - Each item is hashed and optionally mirrored to IPFS.

- **Built-in Security Levels**
  - üü¢ **Standard**: Global tunnels active  
  - üü° **Safer**: Encrypted peers only  
  - üî¥ **Safest**: Fully offline, no external tunnels

- **Web Dashboard**
  - Terminal-inspired green-on-black interface.
  - Fully responsive and local-first.

- **Cross-Platform Support**
  - Runs seamlessly on Android (Termux), Linux, macOS, Windows, etc.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Note:** IPFS mirror requires a running IPFS daemon (`ipfs daemon`) to access content locally.

## üîí Privacy & Security

- No external tracking or analytics.  
- Optional offline mode ensures complete privacy.  
- Security levels let you choose between fully offline or global accessibility.  
- Data files are hashed and stored locally; optional mirroring to IPFS does not expose your identity.  

---

## üß∞ Installation & Setup

QNET 1.0 is cross-platform and runs on **Linux**, **Android (Termux)**, **macOS**, and **Windows (via WSL or Git Bash)**.

Before running QNET, make sure you have:
- Python 3.10+  
- pip (Python package manager)  
- IPFS  
- curl  
- wget  

---

### üîß Quick Setup (Recommended)

QNET includes an automatic environment setup script that installs all dependencies for you.

Run this command from the project folder:
---
bash setup.sh

## üìö Usage

1. Run qnet.py (online/offline)
---
python qnet.py

3. Ensure your IPFS daemon is running for local content:  
---
ipfs daemon

4. Open your preferred mirror

Local: http://127.0.0.1:8080

IPFS: http://127.0.0.1:8081/ipfs/QmSk6tx2phgMny2guUoSgYdBXgMuWCPXT3ppJY8NYGqiLZ

Cloudflare/Ngrok tunnel (auto-generated)

5. Upload files (videos, posts, leaks) via the dashboard.

6. Upload & Manage Content

Upload files under Videos, Posts, or Leaks.

Share IPFS or Cloudflare links directly.

7. Adjust Security Level

Use Settings ‚Üí Security Level to switch between Standard, Safer, or Safest.
